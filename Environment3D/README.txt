This project is a 3D environment that aims to display a few 3D models on a conveyor belt in a room-type setting.



To run: Import Sound and QueasyCam libraries in Processing.

The controls:

Press Spacebar to pause/unpause

Use the mouse to move the camera
Press ’s’ to stop/start the conveyor belt.

Once stopped, press ‘d’ to open/close details window.
Press ‘m’ to start/stop playing the music.



IMPORTANT NOTE: The conveyor belt must be stopped and a 3D model must be in front of the camera for the details window ‘d’ key to function properly. This is an intended functionality.
